# useContext examples

This is working with the React Docs and doing their tutorial on [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext#updating-data-passed-via-context)

- Theme is from: 1. Updating a value via context
- Tasks are from: 5. Scaling Up with Reducer and Context [(full walkthrough)](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context).

I took what they did and converted it to typescript.
